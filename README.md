# SharpPlay

Installer: Coming soon.

SharpPlay: SharpPlay is a music player (think of spotify). SharpPlay is designed for people who love songs/any audio that their favourite music player just doesn't have. SharpPlay not only has all the normal features of a music player but also amazing statistics of what you listen to and a new SUPER SHUFFLE. Instead of going on youtube, you can just get the mp3 file and use my amazing music player!

Tools used for this project: Python

Short term:
Implement super shuffle
Improve control_music function
Improve init_playlists_and_songs so that you can use more than just mp3 songs

Long term:
Add an option to slowly decrease volume over time
Add settings
Add config file
Add statistics
Add easier way to add songs (so user doesn't have to add songs directly into folder)
