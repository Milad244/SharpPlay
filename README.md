# SharpPlay

**Installer**: Coming soon.

**SharpPlay**: SharpPlay is a music player (think of Spotify) designed for people who love songs and any audio that their favorite music player just doesn't have. SharpPlay not only has all the normal features of a music player but also provides amazing statistics about what you listen to, along with a new **SUPER SHUFFLE** feature. Instead of going on YouTube, you can simply get the MP3 file and use my amazing music player!

## Tools Used for This Project
- Python

## Short Term Goals
- Implement Super Shuffle
- Improve `control_music` function
- Enhance `init_playlists_and_songs` to support more than just MP3 files

## Long Term Goals
- Add an option to slowly decrease volume over time
- Add settings menu
- Include a config file
- Add statistics
- Create an easier way to add songs (so users don't have to add songs directly into the folder)
